# TranslateOnLinuxSelections

The [original upstream version](https://github.com/idimitriadis0/TranslateOnLinux) should be used. 

This fork is for selecting tools useful to ScientificPublishing from that list and adding other tools with the same static site generator.

It is unlikely to add anything worth pulling back upstream.

# Tools Potentially Useful for ScientificPublishing

We will be selecting items from upstream and adding other tools to produce our own tools list web site.

Further information will be added here as we do that.
